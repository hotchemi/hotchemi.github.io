From 12/4 to 12/6, there was a Droidcon at Krakow, Poland and I joined it.

May be Krakow isn’t famous in Japan, but I heard it’s kinda like Kyoto, historic and distinctive city in Poland.

The conference was really awesome and I guess half of speakers came from out side of Poland(at least Germany, Italy, France, US, Turkey, Ukraine and Japan!). and sponsors were also global, [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) from Berlin, [Genymobile](http://www.genymobile.com/) from Paris and many other.

Actually this is my first English talk, so I had been so nervous but anyway I did it! I talked about the mechanism and workaround of runtime permissions, and introduced [PermissionsDispatcher 2.0](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher).

All of(most of?) talks were held in Engish and there was a bunch of modern topic like RxJava, Kotlin, Material Design, App Invite, Data Binding and so on.

And I am so pretty glad to talked with cool developers, [@hamen](https://twitter.com/hamen), [@KKonrad1987](https://twitter.com/KKonrad1987), [@KseniiaS](https://twitter.com/KseniiaS), [@protechman](https://twitter.com/protechman), [@ewilly1](https://twitter.com/ewilly1), [@Nilhcem](https://twitter.com/Nilhcem),[@kodipe](https://twitter.com/kodipe), [@sasa_sekulic](https://twitter.com/sasa_sekulic) and [@fernando_cejas](https://twitter.com/fernando_cejas). They are so smart.

Again, I really enjoyed the Droidcon Krakow 2015 and learned a lot of stuff. I really appreciate for [@droidconkr](https://twitter.com/droidconkr)’s great work!

I’m looking forward to the next year:D
