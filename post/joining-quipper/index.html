Awesome!</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>As I said Quipper has been growing up so quickly. I mean, we’re hiring!</p><p>We have a dev team in London, Tokyo and Manilla and recruit Web/iOS/Android developer and UI designer.</p><p>Why not join us and solve educational problem with sexy technology?
